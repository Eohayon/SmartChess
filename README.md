**Description:**

SmartChess is a Bluetooth enabled, smart Chessboard. SmartChess utilizes an integrated circuit to recognize where there are pieces on the board. That information is sent to the accompanying app, which provides the user with a live view of the board. The app can give hints, recommend moves, and enforces legal moves. Development of a mode allowing play against an AI is in progress.

**Background:**

Of my friends and family, I am amongst few individuals that play chess. Many people I have spoken to donâ€™t play chess because they find the game difficult to understand or they forget the rules. I decided to tackle this issue by building a smart Chessboard that would make the game easier, and more intuitive for those that find chess to be intimidating.
